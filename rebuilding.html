      <p>After regaining my footing in life, I started diving deeper into my education in order to find more goals to strive for. I wanted to have the knowledge and experience in order to lay the groundwork for projects that could help people. I want to be a computer scientist, which is such a broad field that it can be overwhelming where to start. In order to figure out what knowledge to strive for and what projects to pursue, I had to start learning a bit about everything. So I began a training journey to help find my place in life.</p>
      <p>I’ve learned a lot more about problems in the world this year. Through modules 4 and 6 in IDEAS, I explored more of the complicated world of wicked problems. I did a lot of research on the changing nitrogen cycle for module 4. My group compiled a lot of information about the topic and why its a wicked problem. In this time I learned a lot about how to identify webs of issues that can come up from small variables. Such as how just using fertilizer has caused immense damage to the Earth’s nitrogen cycle and in turn, drastically affected the environment. More analysis done by my group on this topic can be seen below in our report.</p>

    </div>
    <br>
      
      <div class="container">
        <p>Then in module 6, I learned a lot about identifying side effects of specific plans for solving wicked problems. This kind of thinking will be especially important when analyzing future problems I want to solve. I may one day be developing new technology meant to solve big problems like New Zealand is doing with invasive species. Having the research abilities and various ethical mindsets will help me be able to create better products that can help as many people as possible.</p>
        <p>My education also helped me develop more skills and connections that have allowed me to develop a plan for the future. Mines has a great computer science program with amazing professors that have helped push me in the right direction. The past two semesters I have been working on developing my knowledge of core computer science ideas. The base programming classes have been giving me the tools necessary for working on bigger projects in the future.</p>
        <p>I’ve also been pursuing paths on my own that have let me explore more specific areas of computer science. One such area is web design, which I already had some knowledge on but wanted to dive further into, so I decided to practice for this portfolio assignment. This entire website has been coded by hand, using a framework called Bootstrap. When I was applying for summer internships I noticed that Bootstrap knowledge was a common request for web programming jobs, so I decided to use this project as an opportunity to learn it. It took a while to get used to web programming again, but I'm glad I took the time to learn a new skill and think it paid off. I ran into many hurdles though. For example, I spent several hours trying to create a custom slideshow from scratch for the next section (The Finish Line), however, I came to the conclusion that I could not figure out the small details in my short time frame without help. The biggest issues come from trying to make the page friendly for all screen sizes. I couldn't figure out the kinks to the slideshow so I just made a google presentation and embedded it in. I'll likely come back to this later and try to figure it out.</p>

          <p>Another area I pursued more on my own is computer science research. I managed to get in contact with Professor Tom Williams, head of the MIRRORLab here at Mines. He was gracious enough to let me onto his augmented reality research team, where I have learned how cool robotics and research is. It’s allowed me to make a great connection and given me more options for areas to pursue. These are just a couple of examples of all the opportunities I’ve learned about and experienced this year. It’s helped me truly understand that…</p>
        <p class="font-weight-bold text-center">Knowledge is Power</p>
        <p>After getting back on my feet, I was able to make full use of the education offered here at Mines. I’ve been able to rebuild myself by learning more about areas I’m passionate about which has given me the strength and confidence to move forward with a light at the end of the tunnel. Having the wisdom to back my decisions will be able to set myself up to successfully work on projects that can cause real positive change. I still don’t know exactly what I want to work on but that’s okay because I’ve established the variables necessary for me to continue gaining skills and abilities in the future that will one day be put to good use.</p>
